# 🎩 **ViceStudioPub - Product Manifesto**

## 🚀 **From Marketing Dropout to Indie Studio Founder in 30 Days**

> "We don't wait for credentials. We build credentials."

---

## 📜 **The Origin Story**

**January 15, 2026** - A 27-year-old marketing dropout with zero coding experience opens a terminal for the first time.

**January 18, 2026** - That same person has:
- A functional AI gaming companion with memory persistence
- A noir detective game design with 5,000+ word design doc
- A growing GitHub portfolio demonstrating architectural thinking
- Production logs that rival professional sprint planning

**This is ViceStudioPub. This is what's possible now.**

---

## 🧭 **Our Philosophy**

### **Core Beliefs:**
1. **Credentials are earned, not given** → Your GitHub is your resume
2. **Learning is doing** → No tutorials, just projects
3. **Systems over features** → Build architectures, not just code
4. **Narrative drives technology** → Story first, tech second
5. **Solo today, studio tomorrow** → Start small, think big

### **Development Principles:**
- **Radical Documentation** - If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
- **Progress Over Perfection** - Ship something every 3 days
- **Multi-Project Synergy** - Learn once, apply everywhere
- **Public Building** - Open repos, public logs, transparent journey

---

## 🎮 **Current Portfolio (Active Projects)**

### **1. 🕹️ Steam Game AI Companion** ([Repo](https://github.com/ViceStudioPub/Steam_Game_AI_Companion_Case_Study_2))
**Status:** v0.2 - In Development
**Vision:** An in-game AI companion that learns your playstyle, remembers conversations, and provides context-aware assistance.

**Technical Stack:**
- Flask + Ollama (LLM backend)
- Real-time game detection via Steam API
- JSON-based memory persistence with mood tracking
- Dual interface (Steam Overlay + Web)

**What This Proves:**
- Multi-service architecture design
- Production planning discipline
- User-centric AI implementation

---

### **2. 🕵️‍♂️ Noir Detective Interactive** ([Design Doc](https://chat.deepseek.com/share/qisd02tbrll70ssrte))
**Status:** Concept → Pre-production
**Vision:** A chat-based supernatural noir detective game set in 1930s Manila with a unique "gallery of minds" mechanic.

**Core Mechanics:**
- Evidence collection & deduction systems
- Historical fiction meets supernatural mystery
- Branching narratives with lasting consequences
- Downloadable + SaaS hybrid model

**Why This Matters:**
- Proves narrative design capability
- Demonstrates game economy thinking
- Shows understanding of player psychology

---

### **3. 🌐 Studio Infrastructure** (Various Repos)
**Status:** Continuous improvement
**Vision:** The tools and processes that enable solo studio development.

**Components:**
- Project templates & automation scripts
- Development environment setups
- Documentation standards
- Progress tracking systems

---

## 📊 **Our Development Methodology**

### **The "3-Day Sprint" Cycle:**
```
Day 1: Design + Architecture
Day 2: Implementation + Integration  
Day 3: Documentation + Next Planning
```

### **Progress Tracking:**
Every project maintains:
- **Session Logs** - What was actually accomplished
- **Blockers List** - What's stopping progress
- **Success Criteria** - What "done" looks like
- **Next Steps** - What happens tomorrow

### **Quality Standards:**
1. **Everything commits to GitHub** - No local-only development
2. **READMEs explain the "why"** - Not just the "what"
3. **Code tells a story** - Clean, commented, narrative
4. **Failures are documented** - Learning is public

---

## 🧠 **The Founder's Journey**

### **Who I Am:**
- **Name:** JC (Juichi)
- **Background:** 4th year marketing dropout, 27
- **Location:** GMT+8
- **Starting Point:** January 15, 2026 - Zero coding experience

### **What Changed:**
1. **The Command Line** - Went from scary to essential in 24 hours
2. **GitHub** - Transformed from mystery to portfolio in 48 hours
3. **AI Companionship** - Used AI not just as tool, but as mentor
4. **Systems Thinking** - Saw games not as magic, but as architecture

### **Key Realizations:**
- **Fear of breaking things** → Most things can be fixed
- **"I need credentials"** → My work IS my credential
- **"This takes years"** → Not with modern tooling
- **"I'm just a beginner"** → Beginners ship faster

## 🛠️ **Our Technical Philosophy**

### **Technology Choices:**
- **Start simple, then scale** - JSON before databases
- **AI as collaborator** - Not crutch, but mentor
- **Open source first** - Build in public, learn publicly
- **Documentation as feature** - Code is half the product

### **Development Environment:**
```
OS: Windows (with WSL for Linux tools)
Editor: VS Code
Version Control: Git + GitHub
AI Assistant: DeepSeek (for reasoning) + Cursor (for code)
Project Management: GitHub Projects + Session Logs
```

---

## 📈 **Metrics That Matter**

### **For Us:**
- **Projects shipped** (not just started)
- **Days between commits** (consistency over intensity)
- **Documentation completeness** (README, logs, comments)
- **Learning transfer** (skills from Project A → Project B)

### **For Our Community:**
- **Clarity of explanation** (can beginners understand?)
- **Reproducibility** (can others build our projects?)
- **Inspiration factor** (does this make others want to create?)
- **Honesty in struggles** (do we show the failures too?)

---

## 🌟 **Why This Matters**

### **The Bigger Picture:**
We're proving that:
1. **Traditional education paths aren't the only way**
2. **AI mentorship can compress years into days**
3. **Passion + discipline beats credentials every time**
4. **One person can be an entire studio in 2026**

### **The Industry Impact:**
If we succeed, we demonstrate:
- **New educational models** for aspiring developers
- **AI-augmented creativity** at scale
- **Solo studio viability** in AAA-dominated market
- **Transparent development** as marketing strategy
